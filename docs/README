A test project for doing ORM tests redundantly named

go to build dir and type:

  ant build.localdev.start.launch

and if you are lucky a bunch of crap will happen including a browser launch at 
the end to show you den test run.

If stuff breaks half-way through downloading something, delete:

  ./build/cfdistro/ext/
 
 And try it again.  Resources are only downloaded if they don't exist.
 
 To stop it, in the build dir type:
 
  ant build.localdev.stop


 Force be with you.

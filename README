A test project for doing ORM tests redundantly named

go to build dir and type:

  ant build.localdev.start.launch

and if you are lucky a bunch of crap will happen including a browser launch at 
the end to show you den test run.

If stuff breaks half-way through downloading something, delete:

  ./build/cfdistro/ext/
 

 Force be with you.
